# ccminer v3.8.3 (PBAAS) - Verushash 2.2 - Windows 64-bit

    Custom Windows static build of ccminer with optional CPU temperature monitoring and enhanced stratum client.stats response (and hwinfo API), designed for advanced users mining Verushash 2.2 (PBAAS).

    This build supports optional hardware telemetry reporting, useful for monitoring systems, pools, or proxies requiring additional runtime data.

## What's Included

    - ccminer.exe       : Main mining binary (Verushash 2.2, PBAAS compatible, Win64)
    - cputemp.exe       : Reads CPU temperature using LibreHardwareMonitor
    - updatetemp.exe    : Fetches CPU temp and sends it to running ccminer via TCP (127.0.0.1:4068)
    - LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll : Required DLL for temperature sensor access on Windows


## Features

    - Extended stratum client.stats and hwinfo API replies with optional fields:
      - cpu_temp : CPU temperature (from sensor or external update)
      - khs      : Global hashrate (averaged)

    - Two methods for updating CPU temperature:
      - Automatic: cputemp.exe runs during API/stratum requests if present
      - External: updatetemp.exe pushes temp manually or on schedule

    - Uses LibreHardwareMonitor v0.9.4 for sensor access (https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor)
      - Optional for operation, required only if using cputemp.exe

    (helper binaries are .NET Framework 4.7(Mono 4.7)


## System Requirements

    - OS: Windows 64-bit
    - .NET Framework 4.7 or later (required for helper binaries)
    - Administrator privileges may be needed for CPU temperature access
    - Note: Windows may block unsigned binaries by default — you may need to allow execution manually

## Usage

### Basic Mining

    ccminer.exe -a verus -o stratum+tcp://<pool> -u <wallet>.<worker> -p x

### Option 1: Use cputemp.exe (auto-invoked)

    ccminer.exe -a verus -o stratum+tcp://<pool> -u <wallet>.<worker> -p x

When cputemp.exe is in the same directory as ccminer.exe, it will be executed automatically during each client.stats stratum message or hwinfo API call.

Temperature source priority:
  1. CPU Package temperature
  2. Maximum core temperature (if package not available)
  3. Average core temperature (fallback)

Note: This runs synchronously.

### Option 2: Use updatetemp.exe (manual or scheduled)

    ccminer.exe -a verus -o stratum+tcp://<pool> -u <wallet>.<worker> -p x --api-remote

Run updatetemp.exe separately to push temperature data:

    updatetemp.exe [host] [port]

Examples:

    updatetemp.exe
    updatetemp.exe 127.0.0.1
    updatetemp.exe 127.0.0.1 4068

Defaults:
  - Host: 127.0.0.1
  - Port: 4068

The tool reads local CPU temperature and sends it to ccminer via TCP. You can schedule this using Task Scheduler or a script for periodic updates.

## Development Notes

    The current client.stats extension was implemented based on early assumptions about stratum behavior. A cleaner implementation is being developed in yacffe and will be merged soon to improve stability without breaking existing integrations.

    Temperature reporting is optional:
      - If cputemp.exe is missing or fails, no error occurs — field is omitted.
      - You can disable auto-reads entirely by removing cputemp.exe and use only updatetemp.exe.

    You may safely remove cputemp.exe and rely on external updates (e.g., via cron or Task Scheduler) if preferred.

## Security Notes

    updatetemp.exe communicates with ccminer over TCP on port 4068 (default: 127.0.0.1:4068). This connection is local-only.


## Why

    This build was created to support temperature reporting for proxy-side monitoring in environments where hardware visibility is limited.

    (libcurl build have room for improvements)


## Legal & Ethical

    Use at your own risk. You are running mining software — act responsibly.
    No warranties are provided. The software is distributed "as is".
    Not a lawyer. Not your legal guardian. Don't be stupid.
